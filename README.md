# FCD_R_code
Code created for FCD - Shark Project

This folder contains code in R created while working as a Marine Ecologist at the Charles Darwin Foundation's Biomar Shark Team. A list of the code uploaded to this folder as well as a brief description of what was designed to do will be added to this page.

- AnalysingArgosData.R - Cleans satellite locations of tiger sharks downloaded from ARGOS. Creates point shapefile with water only points. Uses points in a Bayesian State-Space Model (SSM), performs Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) on modelled data and create Percentage Volume Countours (PVCs) - 50%, 75% and 95% as a raster (TIF file).

- TransferringFiles.R - This code lets you copy the entire contents of a hard drive/hard disk/server/USB stick to another hard drive/hard disk/server/USB stick. It can also be used to compare contents between hard drives/hard disks/servers/USB sticks.

- TigerSharkAcousticData.R - Clean acoustic data and create a point plot with acoustic detections over time.
